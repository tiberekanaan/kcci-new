Feature: Landing (Layout Builder) Pages - Check to add sections and choose layouts for sections
As a logged in user with a permission to mange Landing (Layout Builder) pages
I want to be able to add sections with any layouts to the page
So that the "Landing (Layout Builder) page" will show up having the listed section with their content

  Scenario: Check if a user with a permission to manage Landing page (Layout Builder) content type can add sections with any layouts to the page
    Given I am a logged in user with the "test_site_admin" user
     When I go to "node/add/landing_page_lb"
      And I wait
     Then I should see "Create Landing page (Layout Builder)"
     When I fill in "Full Width - No Background Color - Text only" for "Title"
      And I fill in "Test Landing page (Layout Builder) description" for "Page description"
      And I select "published" from "edit-moderation-state-0-state"
      And I press the "Save" button
      And I wait
     Then I should see "Landing page (Layout Builder) Full Width - No Background Color - Text only has been created"
      And I should see "This layout builder tool allows you to configure the layout of the main content area."
     When I click "Add section"
      And I wait for AJAX to finish
     Then I should see "Choose a layout for this section"
      And I should see "Bootstrap 1 Col"
      And I should see "Bootstrap 2 Cols"
      And I should see "Bootstrap 3 Cols"
